**RCT: Gender Bias in Psychiatric Diagnosis**

1. Research Question: To what extent does gender bias influence the diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Panic Disorder in clinical 
   settings?
   * Prior research suggests that gender stereotypes and clinical expectations can influence mental health diagnoses. For example, ADHD is often underdiagnosed in 
     females, who may present with inattentive symptoms rather than hyperactivity, while Panic Disorder may be overdiagnosed in females due to its alignment with 
     stereotypically “emotional” presentations (Bruchmüller et al., 2012; Gershon, 2002).

2. Hypotheses:   
    *H0: The presence of gender information in hypothetical patient cases does not influence the diagnosis of ADHD or Panic Disorder.
    *H1: The presence of gender information in hypothetical patient cases does influence the diagnosis of ADHD or Panic Disorder.
3. Experimental Setting:  
    * Study Population: psychiatrists in diverse healthcare settings (e.g., private clinics, public hospitals).  
    * Country: Argentina
