**RCT: Gender Bias in Psychiatric Diagnosis**

1. Research Question: To what extent does gender bias influence the diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Panic Disorder in?
   * Prior research suggests that gender stereotypes and clinical expectations can influence mental health diagnoses. For example, ADHD is often underdiagnosed in 
     females, who may present with inattentive symptoms rather than hyperactivity, while Panic Disorder may be overdiagnosed in females due to its alignment with 
     stereotypically “emotional” presentations (Bruchmüller et al., 2012; Gershon, 2002).

2. Hypotheses:   
    *H0: The presence of gender information in hypothetical patient cases does not influence the correct diagnosis of ADHD or Panic Disorder
   
    *H1: The presence of gender information in hypothetical patient cases does influence the correct diagnosis of ADHD or Panic Disorder

4. Experimental Setting:  
    * Study Population: psychiatrists in diverse healthcare settings (e.g., private clinics, public hospitals).  
    * Country: Argentina
    * Design: Participants will be shown standardized vignettes for ADHD and Panic Disorder. Each vignette will be randomly assigned a gender identity (cis-het male 
      or cis-het female), while all other information — symptoms, history, and context — will remain identical.

** ADHD Vignette Criteria (based on DSM-5)
- Predominantly inattentive presentation
- Predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation
- Combined presentation
   
   *A diagnosis is based on the presence of persistent symptoms that have occurred over a period of time and are noticeable over the past six months. While ADHD can 
    be diagnosed at any age, this disorder begins in childhood. When considering the diagnosis, the symptoms must be present before the individual is 12 years old 
    and must have caused difficulties in more than one setting. For instance, the symptoms can not only occur at home.

   ** Inattentive type
    Inattentive refers to challenges with staying on task, focusing, and organization. For a diagnosis of this type of ADHD, six (or five for individuals who are 17 
    years old or older) of the following symptoms occur frequently:
    - Doesn’t pay close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in school or job tasks.
    - Has problems staying focused on tasks or activities, such as during lectures, conversations or long reading.
    - Does not seem to listen when spoken to (i.e., seems to be elsewhere).
    - Does not follow through on instructions and doesn’t complete schoolwork, chores or job duties (may start tasks but quickly loses focus).
    - Has problems organizing tasks and work (for instance, does not manage time well; has messy, disorganized work; misses deadlines).
    - Avoids or dislikes tasks that require sustained mental effort, such as preparing reports and completing forms.
    - Often loses things needed for tasks or daily life, such as school papers, books, keys, wallet, cell phone and eyeglasses.
    - Is easily distracted.
    - Forgets daily tasks, such as doing chores and running errands. Older teens and adults may forget to return phone calls, pay bills and keep appointments.
   
   ** Hyperactive/impulsive type
    Hyperactivity refers to excessive movement such as fidgeting, excessive energy, not sitting still, and being talkative. Impulsivity refers to decisions or 
    actions taken without thinking through the consequences. For a diagnosis of this type of ADHD, six (or five for individuals who are 17 years old or older) of the 
    following symptoms occur frequently:
    - Fidgets with or taps hands or feet, or squirms in seat.
    - Not able to stay seated (in classroom, workplace).
    - Runs about or climbs where it is inappropriate.
    - Unable to play or do leisure activities quietly.
    - Always “on the go,” as if driven by a motor.
    - Talks too much.
    - Blurts out an answer before a question has been finished (for instance may finish people’s sentences, can’t wait to speak in conversations).
    - Has difficulty waiting for his or her turn, such as while waiting in line.
    - Interrupts or intrudes on others (for instance, cuts into conversations, games or activities, or starts using other people’s things without permission). Older 
      teens and adults may take over what others are doing.

  ** Combined type
     This type of ADHD is diagnosed when both criteria for both inattentive and hyperactive/impulse types are met.

     
   * Panic Disorder Vignette Criteria (based on DSM-5):
      - During an attack, several of these symptoms occur in combination:
      - Palpitations, pounding heart or rapid heart rate
      - Numbness or tingling
      - Sweating
      - Chills or hot flashes
      - Trembling or shaking
      - Nausea or abdominal pains
      - Feeling of shortness of breath or smothering sensations
      - Feeling detached
      - Chest pain
      - Fear of losing control
      - Feeling dizzy, light-headed or faint
      - Fear of dying
      - Feeling of choking
*Because the symptoms can be quite severe, some people who experience a panic attack may believe they are having a heart attack or some other life-threatening illness. They may go to a hospital emergency department. Panic attacks may be expected, such as a response to a feared object, or unexpected, apparently occurring for no reason. The mean age for onset of panic disorder is 20-24.
