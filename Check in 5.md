**RCT: Gender Bias in Psychiatric Diagnosis**

1. Research Question: To what extent does gender bias influence the diagnoses of mental health disorders?
   * Previous studies and medical records suggest significant misdiagnosis rates for various mental health disorders, with some, such as Generalized Anxiety Disorder 
    (GAD), having misdiagnosis rates as high as 71.0% (Vermani et al., 2011).
   * While symptoms of certain disorders like GAD or Major Depressive Disorder tend to be consistent across gender, diagnosis patterns often differ, raising concerns 
    about the influence of gender bias in clinical decision-making. The use of standardized vignettes allows researchers to isolate the effect of gender cues and 
    examine how these cues may lead to differential diagnostic outcomes for identical symptom presentations.
   * Many mental health diagnoses, especially mood and anxiety disorders, can be provisionally assessed in a single visit, making vignette-based designs a useful and 
   realistic tool for experimental evaluation.

2. Hypotheses:   
    *H0: The presence of gender information in hypothetical patient cases does not influence the diagnosis of mental health disorders.
    *H1: The presence of gender information in hypothetical patient cases does influence the diagnosis of mental health disorders.

3. Experimental Setting:  
    * Study Population: psychiatrists in diverse healthcare settings (e.g., private clinics, public hospitals).  
    * Country: Argentina
