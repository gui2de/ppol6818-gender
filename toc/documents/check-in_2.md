**RCT: Gender Bias in Psychiatric Diagnosis**

1. Research Question: To what extent does gender (male/female) influence the misdiagnosis of Bipolar Disorder (BP) as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) by doctors?  
2. Hypotheses:   
   1. H1: Women with BP symptoms are more likely to be diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), even when symptoms are the same as male counterparts.  
      1. Studies across time show that BP are often initially misdiagnosed and many remain misdiagnosed for even a decade (Hirschfeld et al., 2003; Lish et al., 1994; Singh and Rajput 2006).   
      2. Empirical evidence demonstrates that females with BP are more likely to be misdiagnosed as MDD (Culpepper 2014; Dell’Osso et al., 2021; Lish et al. 1994; Hirschfeld et al. 2003).  
      3. However, there is limited evidence on the reasons behind such gender disparities in misdiagnosis of BP.   
      4. While some recent studies find that more rigorous diagnosis processes (such as more rigorous checklists and steps) may improve the diagnosis rate of BP, there is no explicit research on LIMCs.  
      5. Our research aims to fill the gaps mentioned above.  
   2. H2: Women with BP symptoms are more likely to be misdiagnosed as MDD because of gender difference in symptom presentation rather than gender bias.  
   3. H3: There is no significant gender bias in doctors’ misdiagnosis of Bipolar Disorder (BP) as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).  
3. Experimental Setting:  
   1. Study Population: psychiatrists, or mental health professionals in diverse healthcare settings (e.g., private clinics, public hospitals).  
   2. Country: Argentina  
4. Vignette Design:  
   1. There are two type of patient cases, and the only difference is the patient’s gender (either male or female):  
      1. Male patients  
      2. Female patients  
   2. All symptoms, history, and contextual information remain identical across vignettes and align with DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for both major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder:  
      1. Depressed mood  
      2. Fatigue, low energy  
      3. Difficulty concentrating  
      4. Sleep disturbance (insomnia or hypersomnia)  
      5. No substance use  
      6. No major medical conditions  
5. Randomization:  
   1. Each doctor is randomly assigned to evaluate one of the two vignettes.  
   2. Randomization is stratified by relevant psychiatrist characteristics (eg. years of experience, specialization, rural vs urban, public vs private hospitals).  
6. Outcome Measures  
   1. Primary outcomes:  
      1. The doctors’ diagnosis  
   2. Secondary outcomes:  
      1. The doctors’ perception of the severity of the patient’s symptoms   
         1. Do doctors perceive the severity of the patients’ symptoms differently?  
      2. Treatment recommendations  
      3. Do they mention gendered stereotypes (e.g., "Men don’t like therapy" or "Women handle emotions better")?
