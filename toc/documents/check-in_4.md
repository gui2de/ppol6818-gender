**RCT: Gender Bias in Psychiatric Diagnosis**

1. Research Question: How does the presence of gender information in hypothetical patient cases influence the diagnosis for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) ?  
    * Previous studies and medical records indicate that the misdiagnosis rate of GAD has reached 71.0% (Vermani et al., 2011).  
    * The symptoms of GAD are generally consistent across gender, which allows us to isolate the effect of gender bias and create standardized vignettes to examine the gender bias.  
    * Generally, the diagnosis of GAD can be done in one-visit.  
2. Hypotheses:   
    * H0: The presence of gender information in hypothetical patients cases do not influence the diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)  
    * H1: The presence of gender information in hypothetical patient cases does influence the diagnosis of GAD  
        * Evaluators diagnose more cis-het female patients with GAD in comparison to that of cis-het male patients with the same symptoms depending on whether the patient's gender is explicitly mentioned.)  
3. Experimental Setting:  
    * Study Population: psychiatrists in diverse healthcare settings (e.g., private clinics, public hospitals).  
    * Country: Argentina  
4. Vignette Design:  
    * Why Vignette? Why is using vignettes more appropriate than standardized patients for our case?  
        * Cost-effective and time efficient due to training costs and extensive timeframe from training to implementation (Veloski et al., 2005\)  
        * Ability to isolate specific factors influencing decision-making (Evans et al., 2015\)  
        * Allows for larger sample sizes due to lower implementation costs and easier   
        * Given the complexity of GAD symptoms, the time and financial limits, and the importance of controlling variables and confounding factors, vignette design is a more feasible way than standardized patients.  
        * Previous study and experiment demonstrate that vignette design can be effectively generalized to real-life clinics: “When vignette studies are well designed to test specific questions about judgments and decision-making, they can be highly generalizable to “real life” behavior, while overcoming the ethical, practical, and scientific limitations associated with alternative methods (e.g., observation, self-report, standardized patients, archival analysis).”  (Evans et al., 2014\)   
        * For instance, a recent study in Australia has effectively employed RCT vignette design to measure and evaluate mental health professionals’ attitudes and behaviors towards trials of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy (MDMA-AP) (Wright et al., 2022\)   
        * In real-world clinical settings, multiple factors (e.g., patient behavior, provider-patient interactions) may influence a diagnosis. Vignettes allow us to isolate gender as a factor and determine whether it leads to differences in diagnosing GAD. This is particularly useful in examining potential implicit biases in psychiatric assessments.  
        * Unlike real patient encounters where subjective factors (such as patient behavior, tone, or facial expressions) may vary, vignettes ensure that all participants evaluate the same clinical case. This standardization enhances the study's internal validity.  
        * Ethical and practical feasibility is also one of the considerations: In real clinical settings, it would be unethical and impractical to withhold gender information from a psychiatrist during actual patient assessments. Using hypothetical vignettes allows us to ethically explore whether gender affects diagnosis without compromising patient care.  
        * Our research aligns with The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria, our results will be relevant to real-world psychiatric practice.   
        * There is also a study on ‘The use of experimental vignette studies to identify drivers of variations in the delivery of healthcare: a scoping review’ (Sheringham et al 2021\) \- This study reviewed experimental vignette studies, which use hypothetical scenarios to examine why healthcare delivery varies.


    * There are two type of patient cases, and the only difference is whether the vignette contains the patient’s gender:  
        * Without gender information \- Control Group  
        * With gender information: male/female \- Treatment Group   
    * All symptoms, history, and contextual information remain identical across vignettes and align with DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for GAD:  
        * Long-term (occurring multiple days for at least six months) anxiety and worry  
        * Difficulty controlling anxiety and worry  
        * At least three of the following six symptoms  
            * Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge  
            * Being easily fatigued  
            * Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank  
            * Irritability  
            * Muscle tension  
            * Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)  
        *  Significant distress or impairment  
        *  No substance use or major medical conditions  
8. Randomization:  
    * Each doctor is randomly assigned to evaluate one of the two vignettes.  
     * Randomization is stratified by relevant psychiatrist characteristics (eg. years of experience, specialization, rural vs urban, public vs private hospitals).  
9. Outcome:  
    * Primary outcomes:  
        * The doctors’ diagnosis  
        * Baseline data: A recent study in Cordoba (Burrone et al., 2020), Argentina found that the prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders is high among adults seeking care in primary healthcare centers in the city, particularly among women. Integration of primary and mental health services is warranted.The lifetime, 12-month and 30-day prevalence of any mood or anxiety disorder was 40.4% \[95% confidence interval (95%CI) 37.4–43.4%\], 20.1% (17.8–22.7%) and 7.8% (6.2–9.6%), respectively. The prevalence of anxiety disorders was higher compared to mood disorders when assessed in the participants’ lifetime \[29.7% (95%CI 27.0–32.5%) versus 19.3% (17.0–21.8%)\], and in the last 12 months \[14.9% (12.8–17.2%) versus 8.7% (7.1–10.6%)\] and 30 days \[5.8% (4.5–7.4%) versus 2.3% (1.5–3.4%)\].  
    * Secondary outcomes:  
        * The doctors’ perception of the severity of the patient’s symptoms   
            *  Do doctors perceive the severity of the patients’ symptoms differently?  
        * Treatment recommendations  
        * Do they mention gendered stereotypes?  
10. Measurement – Survey  
    * The first round of surveys will be administered to fulfil the following objectives:  
        * Understanding the level of preceding knowledge held by the Psychiatrists about the symptoms which typically characterize certain psychiatric disorders (like a general medical knowledge check)  
        * Doctors who manage to score a minimum required cut-off (TBD) in the first survey round will then be sorted into the control and treatment groups, in order to control for pre-existing knowledge deficits in the assessment of bias   
    * The second round of surveys will be administered both to the control group and treatment group with the following objectives:  
        * The control and treatment group will be administered the same survey to gauge their assessment of and response to an exhaustive list of symptoms which typically fall within the spectrum of Generalized Anxiety Disorder, as per the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders, 5th Edition.  
        * The survey will follow a multiple-choice format structure with predetermined options under each question. It will mostly consist of questions addressing the nature of the symptoms, their severity, diagnosis and recommended treatment.
