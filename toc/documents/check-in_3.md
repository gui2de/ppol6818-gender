**RCT: Gender Bias in Psychiatric Diagnosis**

1. Research Question: How does the presence of gender information in hypothetical patient cases influence the diagnosis for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) ?  
* Previous studies and medical records indicate that the misdiagnosis rate of GAD has reached 71.0% (Vermani et al., 2011).  
* The symptoms of GAD are generally consistent across gender, which allows us to isolate the effect of gender bias and create standardized vignettes to examine the gender bias.  
* Generally, the diagnosis of GAD can be done in one-visit.  
2. Hypotheses:   
* H0: The presence of gender information in hypothetical patients cases do not influence the diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)  
* H1: The presence of gender information in hypothetical patient cases does influence the diagnosis of GAD  
  * Evaluators diagnose more cis het women patients with GAD in comparison to that of cis het male patients with the same symptoms depending on whether the patient's gender is explicitly mentioned.)  
3. Experimental Setting:  
   1. Study Population: psychiatrists in diverse healthcare settings (e.g., private clinics, public hospitals).  
   2. Country: India (more literature needed)  
4. Vignette Design:  
   1. Why Vignette?  
* Given the complexity of GAD symptoms, the time and financial limits, and the importance of controlling variables and confounding factors, vignette design is a more feasible way than standardized patients.  
* Previous study and experiment demonstrate that vignette design can be effectively generalized to real-life clinics: “When vignette studies are well designed to test specific questions about judgments and decision-making, they can be highly generalizable to “real life” behavior, while overcoming the ethical, practical, and scientific limitations associated with alternative methods (e.g., observation, self-report, standardized patients, archival analysis).”  (Evans et al., 2014\) 
* For instance, a recent study in Australia has effectively employed RCT vignette design to measure and evaluate mental health professionals’ attitudes and behaviros towards trials of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy (MDMA-AP) (Wright et al., 2022\) 
  2. There are two type of patient cases, and the only difference is whether the vignette contains the patient’s gender:  
     1. Without gender information \- Control Group  
     2. With gender information: male/female \- Treatment Group   
  3. All symptoms, history, and contextual information remain identical across vignettes and align with DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for GAD:  
     1. Long-term (occurring multiple days for at least six months) anxiety and worry  
     2. Difficulty controlling anxiety and worry  
     3. At least three of the following six symptoms  
        1. Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge  
        2. Being easily fatigued  
        3. Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank  
        4. Irritability  
        5. Muscle tension  
        6. Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)  
     4. Significant distress or impairment  
     5. No substance use or major medical conditions  
5. Randomization:  
   1. Each doctor is randomly assigned to evaluate one of the two vignettes.  
   2. Randomization is stratified by relevant psychiatrist characteristics (eg. years of experience, specialization, rural vs urban, public vs private hospitals).  
6. Outcome:  
   1. Primary outcomes:  
      1. The doctors’ diagnosis  
   2. Secondary outcomes:  
      1. The doctors’ perception of the severity of the patient’s symptoms   
         1. Do doctors perceive the severity of the patients’ symptoms differently?  
      2. Treatment recommendations  
      3. Do they mention gendered stereotypes?  
7. Measurement – Survey  
* The first round of surveys will be administered to fulfil the following objectives:  
  * Understanding the level of preceding knowledge held by the Psychiatrists about the symptoms which typically characterize certain psychiatric disorders (like a general medical knowledge check)  
  * Doctors who manage to score a minimum required cut-off (TBD) in the first survey round will then be sorted into the control and treatment groups, in order to control for pre-existing knowledge deficits in the assessment of bias   
* The second round of surveys will be administered both to the control group and treatment group with the following objectives:  
  * The control and treatment group will be administered the same survey to gauge their assessment of and response to an exhaustive list of symptoms which typically fall within the spectrum of Generalized Anxiety Disorder, as per the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders, 5th Edition.  
  * The survey will follow a multiple-choice format structure with predetermined options under each question. It will mostly consist of questions addressing the nature of the symptoms, their severity, diagnosis and recommended treatment.
